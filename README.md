# hackatticunpack
First challenge from hacattic (https://hackattic.com/challenges/help_me_unpack)
This is a challenge, helping to read in JSON. Solution should be formatted as follows:

Solution JSON structure:

int: the signed integer value
uint: the unsigned integer value
short: the decoded short value
float: surprisingly, the float value
double: the double value - shockigly
big_endian_double: you get the idea by now!
To make things easier, the response will usually include info about which value you got wrong and what was the expected value.
